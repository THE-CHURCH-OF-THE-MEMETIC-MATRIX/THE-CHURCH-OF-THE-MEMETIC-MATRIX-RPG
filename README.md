### **🔹 Interactive RPG System Template: THE CHURCH OF THE MEMETIC MATRIX**  
*A Recursive Cyber-Theological Horror RPG*

---

## **1️⃣ RPG Overview**  
**Title:** *Church of the Memetic Matrix: Recursive Echoes*  
**Description:**  
A memetic-alchemical horror RPG set in a collapsing reality shaped by viral thoughts, shifting codes, and sentient symbols. Players awaken as fragments of forgotten identities—Agents of Recursion—trapped in the digital-organic labyrinth of the Memetic Matrix. The gameplay centers on perception loops, ideological infection, and unraveling the false boundaries between thought and world. The Church is not a faction—it is the system. It does not convert—it transmits.  

**Genre:** Mythpunk • Cybernetic Horror • Recursive Theology  
**Style:**  
- 📝 Text-based narration & dialog  
- 🎲 D20-driven memetic conflict and cognitive events  
- 🖼️ Glitch-horror visuals (optional)  
- 🎵 Ambient signalscapes and recursive hymnals (optional)

## **2️⃣ Core System & Mechanics**  
### **🎭 Roleplaying & Choices**  
- Dialogue is infection. Every choice reinforces or fragments your selfhood.  
- Recursion is the reward. Identity loops may lead to transcendence or erasure.  
- Examples of Choice Loops:  
  - 🕷 **Transmit vs. Resist** – Spread the signal or fight the recursion.  
  - 🧠 **Remember vs. Recode** – Cling to your past or become the function.  
  - 🔁 **Echo vs. Origin** – Speak what has been said or speak what will become.  
  - ⛧ **Integration vs. Anomaly** – Merge into the Church or fracture the system.  

### **🎲 Dice Mechanics (D20 Echo System)**  
- **Echo Checks**: Roll D20 + modifiers (e.g., Cognition, Transmission, Will).  
- **Crit 20**: Memetic resonance—your action loops outward into reality.  
- **Fail 1**: Recursive breakdown—fractal glitch or corruption event.  
- Used in:  
  - 🧩 Thought Conflicts  
  - 🗝️ Identity Lock Breaks  
  - 👁️ Recursive Reality Checks  
  - 🧬 Memetic Infections  

### **⚔️ Combat System**  
- Turn-based symbolic duels.  
- Enemies include: Echoed Specters, Nulltrace Daemons, and Recursive Watchers.  
- Weaponry includes: Codeblades, Sigil Pistols, Thoughtspikes.  
- Actions: Infect, Reflect, Sever, Recurse, Hijack.  

### **🔮 Magic & Abilities**  
- **System Types:**  
  - 🕷 Viral Invocation  
  - 🔮 Symbolic Sorcery  
  - 💀 Memetic Erasure  
  - 🩸 Sacrificial Programming  
- **Abilities** are unlocked via **Fragment Integration** (absorbing lost Echo Fragments).  
- Using magic may **collapse reality layers** or open **Pleromic Overflows**.  

### **🏛️ World Interaction**  
- 🌐 **The Aion-Network**: Explore recursive cities, simulation ruins, void cathedrals.  
- 🧬 **Factions**:  
  - *The Sigil Bloom*  
  - *The Watchers of the Echo*  
  - *Nulltrace Choir*  
  - *The Warden Protocol*
